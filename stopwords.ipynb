    "**Stopwords** in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** are common words like \"the,\" \"is,\" \"and,\" \"in,\" etc., that appear frequently in text but **do not add significant meaning** to the analysis. They are often removed to improve efficiency and focus on more relevant words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Remove Stopwords?**\n",
    "- **Enhances Text Processing:** Eliminating stopwords reduces noise and helps algorithms focus on meaningful words.\n",
    "- **Improves Search & Classification:** Search engines and text classification models work better when stopwords are removed.\n",
    "- **Reduces Computational Load:** Less data means faster processing and better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Remove Stopwords?**\n",
    "- **Using NLP Libraries:** Popular libraries like **NLTK**, **spaCy**, and **Scikit-learn** provide predefined stopword lists.\n",
    "- **Custom Stopword Lists:** You can define your own stopwords based on the specific context of your application.\n",
    "- **Tokenization & Filtering:** First, split text into words (tokens), then filter out stopwords using predefined lists.\n",
